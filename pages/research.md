Identification of functional genomic regions underlying phenotypic traits
The development of high throughput sequencing and genotyping technologies, as well as statistical methods, makes it possible to dissect the genetic architecture of phenotypic traits of interests.  To clarify the genomic architecture of milk traits in Murciano-Granadina goats, I performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) between genome-wide SNP genotypes and dairy traits recorded in 822 Murciano-Granadina goats [19]. This analysis allowed me to identify 24 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that reached the threshold of significance (q-value ≤0.05) either at the genome-wide or chromosome-wide levels. Quantitative trait locus 6 (QTL6) on chromosome 6 was highly associated with protein percentage at the genome-wide level of significance (78.90-93.48 Mb), and also with dry matter (84.67-86.86 Mb) and fat percentages (86.86 Mb) at the chromosome-wide level of significance. In addition, we found genome-wide significant associations for lactose percentage on chromosome 2 (QTL1, 130.72-131.01 Mb), as well as for protein and dry matter percentages on chromosome 17 (QTL17, 11.20 Mb). At the chromosome-wide level, we found 21 significant associations but only two of them were supported by more than 2 SNPs (QTL9 for somatic cell count and QTL24 for lactose percentage). In addition, I joined the efforts to identify genomic regions associated with body conformation and hematological trats [20,21].
