		  Dailu Guan received a Bachelor's degree in Animal Science and a Master's degree in Animal Genetics and Breeding from Southwest University. He then earned his Ph.D. in Animal Genomics from the Autonomous University of Barcelona in 2020. In 2021, he joined Huaijun Zhou's group as a postdoctoral researcher, where he was trained in computational epigenomics. Currently, I am a project scientist working in the Department of Animal Science at the University of California, Davis.

	  I specialize in the field of computational and quantitative genomics, dedicating my research to dissecting the genetic and epigenetic architecture of complex agricultural traits. My specific research aims include identifying causal variants, genes, and pathways underlying complex traits within tissue, cellular, and genomic native contexts through the combination of state-of-the-art multi-omics datasets (e.g., WGS, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, RRBS, WGBS, Hi-C) and cutting-edge methodologies (e.g., genome-wide association studies, deep learning). My research will deepen our understanding of the vast spectrum of complex traits in humans, animals and plants, promise knowledge discovery and advance agricultural practices. Ultimately, this research is positioned to equip us with the knowledge and tools needed to navigate and manipulate the complex genetic foundations of the traits that shape our world.

        <h3>Complex Traits Genetics</h3>

	        The central dogma of molecular biology suggests that DNA sequence variations impact phenotypes through the processes of transcription and translation, mediated by complex layers of multi-omic regulation. Thus, annotating functional genomic elements and deciphering how sequence variants influence these elements are crucial for connecting phenotype-associated variants with gene regulatory mechanisms across genomic, cellular, tissue, and environmental contexts. My prior research has illuminated the regulatory impacts of genetic variants on gene transcription, yet these impacts account for only a fraction of the GWAS loci associated with complex traits[27], indicating the existence of additional molecular mechanisms at play. I hypothesize that the genetic architecture of complex traits in farm animals is shaped by the individual and combined effects of epigenetic and transcriptional regulation, protein translation, as well as environmental factors, particularly within specific tissues or cell types. Moving forward, my goal is to uncover the regulatory impacts of genetic variants across a spectrum of omic layers, including but not limited to DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, histone modification, chromatin conformation, protein abundance, and microbiome composition. Furthermore, my focus will extend to exploring how the interplay between genetics and environmental contexts (such as development, heat stress, undernutrition, and disease states) affects those molecular activity and regulation.

                The dramatic decrease in sequencing costs has precipitated an extensive accumulation of genomic and epigenomic data, especially for model species such as humans and mice, exemplified by consortia efforts like the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics projects. Despite these advances, the availability of data for other species, especially farm animals, remains notably sparse or incomplete. The financial limitations inherent in the farm animal research field underscore the challenges of generating comparable diverse data resources as those available for humans. To address this gap, I aim to undertake cross-species data harmonization, leveraging cutting-edge methodologies, such as deep learning, to transfer insights from one species to another. This endeavor will involve large-scale data analysis and integration, and the creation of sophisticated pipelines or bioinformatic tools designed to transfer genomic and epigenomic data across species, from model species (e.g., human, mouse) to non-model species (e.g., pigs, cows). For example, I am going to create a uniform computational pipeline to align human and mouse data to farm animal genomes. In addition, I will develop novel tools to impute missing epigenomic data in farm animals by learning existing epigenomic signals in human and mouse, as well as to predict new data de novo across species. The innovation of this research lies in its focus on cross-species data imputation and prediction, setting it apart from the majority of mainstream tools that are limited to within-species analyses. The anticipated results and models are expected to enhance the annotation of genomes in non-model species, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic variations across species, tissues, and developmental stages, with a focus on non-model animals, particularly farm animals. This work promises to significantly enrich our understanding of the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms that implicate gene regulation and complex traits genetics.
